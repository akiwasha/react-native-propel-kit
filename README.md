## Description

**React Native Propel Kit** is a [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) library providing basic **building blocks** for your next mobile application! This library is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using exclusively functional components leveraging [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

This library is **structured as a monorepo** that enables you to require only specific sub-packages if you ever want to build upon it.
